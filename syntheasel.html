            </div>
            <p> SYNTHEASEL was created for my final year university project. The project was largely self governed and ran over the term of one semester.
                <br><br>
                SYNTHEASEL’s primary objective is to provide users with creative tools to craft unique music visualizations that enhance their emotional connection and interaction with music. This web application draws inspiration from common art programs and applies real-time effects to brushes based on the song’s attributes. Our design philosophy is rooted in ludic and short, focused interactions, aiming to bring users closer to their favorite songs, promote relaxation, and spark creativity featuring, User-driven music visualizations, Real-time brush interactions, Dynamic color palettes based on key and mode and Brush behavior linked to tempo and frequencies.
                                <br><br>
                SYNTHEASEL’s design is the result of extensive user research into drawing observations and individual musical analysis. This research ensures that the tools provided are both accurate and enjoyable for users. The project is hosted on GitHub pages and is built using front-end languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on the p5.js and p5.sound libraries.
                <br><br>
                SYNTHEASEL is an interactive music visualization web application that bridges the gap between music and visual art. By enabling users to create personalized visualizations, it adds a new dimension to the music experience. Each interaction is a journey of self-expression and exploration, fostering a deeper connection between users and the music they love.
